Create a simple React application that has a form with two input fields (for "First Name" and "Last Name") and a submit button.
When the user submits the form, display the full name (concatenation of first and last name) in a separate section of the page.

You can use create-react-app to bootstrap the project.

Make sure to include proper validation for the form fields (e.g. the fields should not be empty when the user submits the form).
